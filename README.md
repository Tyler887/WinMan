# WinMan - Manual pager for Windows
WinMan stands for ***Win**dows **Man**ual Pager*. It adds `man` to Windows to allow help on
any command. Manpages are written as plain text (Roff will be translated to plain text),
but WinMan uses `more` as the default pager, but can be changed in your `winman-config.yaml`
(if you understand the syntax of YAML).
## Install
Executables for installing WinMan on your Windows system can be downloaded from
[the releases page](https://github.com/Tyler887/WinMan/releases).
## Adding manual pages
You can add a WinMan manual to your system by downloading it (e.g. download and add the
[manual page for WinMan](winman.1)). Some program installers might also install the manual for
the program.
